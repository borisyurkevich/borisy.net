# About.

Welcome to Cocoa Switch, blog about software, technology and games. Trying to focus on things which is not told anywhere else. Also posting photos which I used to post to Instagram.

I am software engineer living in London with my wife and son.

Although I am posting links here, I don't want this to be a link blog and when posting a link, there's something I would like to add.

Not writing regularly and not covering news because there's writers who can do it much better.

## Why "Cocoa Switch."

The name inspired by Apple Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, my love to chocolate, *switching* from PC to Mac in 2007 and new Nintendo console.
