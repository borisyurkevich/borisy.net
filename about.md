## About Me.

<div id="shot"></div>

My name is Boris Yurkevich. I am a developer.

Cocoa Switch is a blog to give you insight into my though process, projects I am working on and opinions about wonderful world of technology.

I work as iOS developer at my day job. I spend free time crafting my own apps. I have published [Caffeine++,](https://cocoaswitch.com/caffeine++) [Altershot](https://cocoaswitch.com/altershot) and [123 Trim](https://cocoaswitch.com/123Trim) through the App Store.  In the late 2020 I decided to get serious about independent publishing. I am starting new indie software [business](https://cocoaproduction.com) and I can't wait to share my  creations with you.

I have a family and 2 kids, we live in UK. I like having music when I'm in the zone. Occasionally I would raise my desk. Most of my day I would spend with Xcode and [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html). I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07FNHV4MW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B07FNHV4MW&linkCode=as2&tag=blogaffilia02-21&linkId=6fa86e2fa0f9b61647362a7e50c8f0c8">Logitech MX Vertical</a> mouse, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00HVLUR86/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00HVLUR86&linkCode=as2&tag=blogaffilia02-21&linkId=c67d089ef46b5aa9ed4ea6357a0b4240">Audio-Technica ATH-M50X</a> headphones and standard external keyboard from Apple. At this moment my main computer is MacBook Pro 13' 2014.
