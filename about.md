Welcome to Cocoa Switch.

This blog is my own opinions. I feel passionate about Open Web and independent content creation. This blog fulfilling my desire to write and share with others.

I am Cocoa Touch software engineer living in London, writing about software, technology and, sometimes, games. 

The name inspired by Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, my love to chocolate, *switching* from PC to Mac in 2007 and new Nintendo console.

Focus of this blog is expressing my thoughts on things which I feel I have to share. I am trying to write only when I feel like telling something which has not been told before, things which is missed or not noticed.

I am not writing regularly and not covering news because there's people who can do it much better and doing this for long time already, some of them even for a living, this people inspiring me to write.

Although I am posting links here, I don't want this blog to be a link blog and when posting a link there's something I would like to add.
