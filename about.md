# About.

Welcome to Cocoa Switch blog. I feel passionate about Open Web and independent content creation. This blog fulfilling my desire to write and share my opinion with others.

I am software engineer living in London, writing about software, technology and, sometimes, games. 

Focus of this blog is expressing my thoughts and feelings about things which I want to share. I am trying to focus on something which has not been told before, things which is missed or not noticed.

Although I am posting links here, I don't want this blog to be a link blog and when posting a link there's something I would like to add.

I am not writing regularly and not covering news because there's writers who can do it much better.

## Why "Cocoa Switch."

The name inspired by Apple Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, my love to chocolate, *switching* from PC to Mac in 2007 and new Nintendo console.

## How This Works.

I am proud that this website has zero JavaScript, which means good efficiency and no tracking.
