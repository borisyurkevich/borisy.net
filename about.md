## About This Blog.

Welcome to Cocoa Switch, blog about software, technology and games. Focussing on things which is not told anywhere else.

Although I am posting links here, I don't want this to be a link blog and when posting a link, there's something I would like to add.

Not writing regularly and not covering news because there's writers who can do it much better.

I'am iOS programmer from London. I have wife and 2 kids.

### Why "Cocoa Switch."

The name inspired by Apple Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, my addiction to chocolate, *switching* from PC to Mac and new Nintendo console.

### How This Works.
