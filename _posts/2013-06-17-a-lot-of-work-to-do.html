<p>iOS 7 is not like all previous. It’s not an evolution. It’s the unique opportunity for developers. The turning point.</p>

<p><em>If you’re the “IT guy” for your family, extended family, wife’s family, etc., Apple just ruined the end of your year.</em>

<p>I took a week off to watch all WWDC13 videos. Whole week only to realise what we can do with new iOS. It was my first WWDC and now I know that the keynote is only a tip of an iceberg. I had great moments of inspiration. I stopped playing StarCraft Ⅱ, I stopped visiting my family, I even rescheduled the date with my lovely girlfriend. I picked up dusty Moleskine from shelf and now I’m carrying it around all the time. I lost my sleep trying make some ideas to work.</p>

<p>When I’m imagining what opportunities we got — I feel weird good feeling in my stomach — like something big is coming. Enough of energy to work all this year. Now it’s our turn, dear fellows developers.</p>
