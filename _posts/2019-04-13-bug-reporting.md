Greg Scown, writing for Code Cook Read:

> First and foremost, write good bugs. This is fairly easy to do, though it can be time-consuming. If you’re not already familiar with bugreport.apple.com that’s the site for reporting bugs to Apple. When you create a new bug, Apple includes a template in the description for exactly how they want you to report your bug. Apple isn’t looking for you to create your own format or to report things entirely in prose. They also include a handy page of tips for reporting bugs which you should follow.

Greg's article inspires to do a better job [reporting bugs to Apple.][1] Reducing the scope, if possible, and reading Apple manual is 2 excellent take aways. Whenever I get a reply on a bug, it's usually asking for `sysdiagnose` report with PDF manual attached. I had no idea that yo can get all manuals in advance from [the Apple tips page.][2] Let's write better bug reports, targeted to the cause and with as much information attached as possible.
