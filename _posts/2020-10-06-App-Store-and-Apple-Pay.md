I know it seams obvious, but for a long time you couldn't choose Apple Pay, Apple own payment system, when setting up your Apple ID. I needed to update my card yesterday and have noticed the new option. I am attaching the screenshot, have you noticed Apple Pay icon? It used to say "App Store". 

This brings new possibilities:

- User can provide payment details only once, configure default, and choose a different card for each purchase.
- Hopefully, if your app supports In-App Purchase, your customers now can pay with Apple Pay. Before that, Apple Pay was only allowed for physical goods, and required complex setup. I think 30% cut remains, but it potentially can allow Apple to switch to a 0% cut and just have much smaller commission they get from banks when you use Apple Pay.
- User can use Wallet app settings to set a default card, instead of iOS payment settings.

Putting simply, if you can use Apple Pay to pay for your commute, buy a loaf of bread, or any web purchase, you now also can use the same technology when buying software on the App Store, wonderful.
