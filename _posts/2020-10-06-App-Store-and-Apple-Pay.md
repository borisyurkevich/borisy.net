I know it seems obvious, but for a long time, you couldn't choose Apple Pay, Apple's own payment system, when setting up your Apple ID. I needed to update my card yesterday and have noticed the new option. I am attaching the screenshot, have you noticed the Apple Pay icon? It used to say "App Store".

This could bring new possibilities:

- User can provide payment details only once, configure default, and choose a different card for each purchase.
- Hopefully, if your app supports In-App Purchase, your customers now can pay with Apple Pay. Before that, Apple Pay was only allowed for physical goods, and required complex setup. I think 30% cut remains, but it potentially can allow Apple to switch to a 0% cut and just have much smaller commission they get from banks when you use Apple Pay.
- User can use Wallet app settings to set a default card, instead of iOS payment settings.

Putting simply, if you can use Apple Pay to pay for your commute, buy a loaf of bread, or any web purchase, you now also can use the same technology when buying software on the App Store, wonderful.

### Update, October 8

I was billed for my iCloud Storage and the payment went through my card as usual. When I tried to remove this card from Apple ID payment settings, iOS told me I have to have at least one payment method available, despite that I have a second Apple Pay option configured in the list of payment methods. I am not sure is because I am a family organiser, but, most likely, you still have to have card details entered into your Apple ID. Apple Pay won't be used for iCloud storage billing, and, possibly, subscriptions.

I have changed the post tile from "App Store now Supports Apple Pay" to the new one and changed  "This brings new possibilities:" to "This could bring new possibilities:".
