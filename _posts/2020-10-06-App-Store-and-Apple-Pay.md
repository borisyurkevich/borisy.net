I know it seams obvious, but for a long time you couldn't choose Apple Pay — Apple own payment system when setting up a payment method for your Apple ID. I needed to update my  card yesterday and have noticed Apple Pay as one of the options. I am attaching the screenshot, notice Apple Pay icon, it used to say "App Store". 

This brings new possibilities:

- User can provide payment details only once, configure default, and choose any of available of each purchase.
- If your app supports In-App Purchase, your customer now can pay with Apple Pay. Before that, Apple Pay was only allowed for physical goods, and you will have to do a lot of setup to make it work. This is unconfirmed.
- User can pay with default card, but choose any card during the payment process.

Putting simply, if you can use Apple Pay to pay for your commute, buy a loaf of bread, or any web purchase, you now also can use the same technology when buying software on the App Store, wonderful.
