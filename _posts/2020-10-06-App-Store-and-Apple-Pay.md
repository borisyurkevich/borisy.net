Since when the App Store and, assuming, iTunes Store began accepting Apple Pay? I needed to update my credit card yesterday and have noticed Apple Pay as one of the options. I am attaching the screenshot, notice Apple Pay icon in the top right corner. Before it said "App Store". 

This brings 2 new possibilities:

- If your bank supports Apple Pay, you won't need to enter your card number again for iTunes and App Store.
- Pay with your default card, but choose any card during the payment process.

Putting simply, if you use Wallet app to pay for a loaf of bread, you now also can use the same flow when buying software, wonderful. 

_Running iOS 13.7, UK App Store. I don't see this on the Mac._
