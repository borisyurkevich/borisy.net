### Why Now.

RSI[^1] is not a new issue, why I am writing about this now? Following things happened.

1. Larger and larger smartphone sizes.
2. Nintendo Switch is released.
3. Many people started to use iPad as their primary computer.

Bad news for your hands. We use iPhone a lot. Larger touch screens force your fingers to stretch and work harder.  The Switch allows you to take one of the best games ever made with you, but it's heavy and Joy-Con controls are tiny, if you have moderate or large hands, your fingers are crippled. iPad is more about healthy posture and office desk ergonomics.

### Solutions.

1. Choose smartphone with a small screen.
2. Use large Pro Controller, give your Switch support while playing, reduce wrist strain.
3. Use external keyboard and stands when working on iPad.

Also there's some simple rules.

* Type as light and quite as you can.
* Move and shift your entire hands and shoulders.
* Don't rest your wrists while typing.
* Don't stretch your finger in unnatural positions while typing.
* Use stronger fingers more, press larger keys with multiple fingers to reduce required force.
* Position your keyboard flat.
* Give your hands and body regular breaks.

### Keyboard Travel Time.

I have a theory that newer quiter keyboards are ergonomically safer. New thinner MacBook Pro/Air keyboards are not reliable, Apple gets a lot of criticism and rightfully so. However, smaller travel means that your hands have to do less work to press each key. RSI caused by micro injuries in hand muscles. More travel means more force. Each indivudual press is harmless, but when repeating it thousands times, it can accumalte to a big amout of force which your hands have to deal with. Also, loud typers are at greater risk, and new keyboard are all about quiter typing.

### Wrapping Up.

The most positive scenario is when you treat your hands with respect and don't injure yourself in a first place. That's the easier and healthier option. I am fortunate to have heathy hands so far, however I had experienced warning signs and I have not ignored them since. I am careful about my hands, particularly, how do I type and play. You should be to. There's many kinds of RSI, but the one I am concerned the most is the one which injures you wrists to a point that you can't type without a pain or can't type and play any more at all. The only cure is time and full recovery is not guaranteed.

We don't speak about RSI enough. It's a life injury and it's happening around us. Normally, only people who already experienced RSI taking measures and talking about it,[^2] while what everyone in software industry should do more, is to take preventing measures. I am calling for more RSI awareness among people in software. 

### Further Reading.

I recommend [this book (Amazon),](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002CA2K54) which is only available in print. Used price is not bad at all. If you know me in person, I will happily let you borrow it.
