<p>During my day I have a lot of 8–12 minutes time intervals when I’m alone, I have my iPad / iPhone and online. </p>

<p>I should inbox zero my Mail, Drafts and OmniFocus during this periods.</p>

<ol><li>Doing every day so I will never miss anything important.</li>
<li>Doing it quick, I have limited time so I can’t afford start worrying about items, I have to assign the project and context.</li>
<li>Doing in strict order Mail, Drafts, OmniFocus. Every item will end in OmniFocus, most trustable and reviewable tool.</li>
<li>Don’t do it when hanging out with other person. It’s unpolite and contr-productive.</li>
<li>If I got an item with real deadline, I should set it in OmniFocus.</li>
<li>If during cleaning inbox I got new item on top, I will ignore it until tomorrow.</li>
<li>If an item is a doable action with 2 minutes max duration, I should do it.</li>
</ol>
