<p>My thanks to iOS developers at Microsoft. Our university is using Google Apps, so we have Gmail, Calendar, Contacts and Drive. Outlook displays everythIng in one place. You can jump between them with a single tap from the well known tab bar at the bottom. Well made!</p>

<p>My favorite detail is *the blank screen after archiving an email.* I am inbox zero completionist. I was looking for this for years. Sometimes, especially, on mobile devices, you don’t have time to clean inbox, and it is important to have an ability to stop working on your email at any time, with all remaining inbox letters marked as unread and hidden.</p>

<p>If you’ll try to archive an email message in any other client, you’ll immediately get next message. It’s exhausting, stressful rarely ending process. In Outlook, opening next message is your conscious decision. You are doing this when you have enough time and resources.</p>
