<p>Today Apple approved my app called NumPick. It&rsquo;s simple tool for extracting numbers from text.</p>

<p>Long time ago when I learned my first programming language Java our teacher Yakov Fain told us how he hates when you can&rsquo;t put your phone number on the web form site because it has characters like &ldquo;-&rdquo;, &ldquo;+&rdquo;, &ldquo;()&rdquo; or even blank space. He told us that every programmer should know how to parse a number from text.</p>

<p>I tried to make many apps but failed because idea was too complicated. So I decided to fix smallest issue I can handle.</p>

<p>I learned one thing. Before starting, build a prototype on a paper. It could save you a lot of time. I learned it from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/" title="WWDC 2014 videos">WWDC video &ldquo;Prototyping: Fake It Till You Make It.&rdquo;</a> It will be useful for any developer, designer or even marketing guy. I wish I would watched this video before starting  work on NumPick.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numpick/id891432865?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Download NumPick on the App Store.</a> I also made a <a href="http://borisy.net/numpick">web page.</a></p>
