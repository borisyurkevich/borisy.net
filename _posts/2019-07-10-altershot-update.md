Today I am releasing update for one of my hobby projects. I've refined user interface and added support for latest Apple devices. 

Altershot is the marketing tool for your screenshots. It simplifies Status Bar appearance to focus viewer attention on your app. [Get it from the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/altershot-status-bar-editor/id911930618) Altershot is free and contains no in-app purchases at this moment.

Full list of changes.

- Added support for iPhone XS Max and XR
- Added support for all new iPad models with iOS 12 look
- Added support for new Apple Watch screenshots (Series 4)
- Larger 1 to 1 screenshots preview
- Improved Dynamic Type
- Cut larger portion of the upper screen on iPhone X and newer to produce better looking screenshots
- Updated About screen with small text descriptions
- Improved user interface
- Shorter file names for exported screenshots
- Fixed issue when removing iPhone X status bar in Photos extension
- Internal improvements to reduce application size in future iOS versions
