> We all want Apple to buy Nintendo. But now it makes sense.

It doesn't make sense. Nintendo is a hardware company as much as they are software company. Games published by Nintendo always released for a single platform, with physical controller included, while Apple Arcade is more about simpler games which can ran on multiple devices with or without a controller. Nintendo makes profit from every console they sell, not just games. And games they made take full advantage of hardware. Their hardware doesn't need to be an everyday computer and can cost less, lowering entry barrier. Nintendo 2DS costs $80, Apple will never make an iOS device so cheap.

What really makes sense is Nintendo mobile games on Apple Arcade. Apple doesn't need to buy Nintendo to make this happen. Super Mario Run playable without internet connection, that's what we need.
