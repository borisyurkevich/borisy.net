> We all want Apple to buy Nintendo. But now it makes sense.

It doesn't make sense. Nintendo is a hardware company as much as they are a software company. Games published by Nintendo always released for a single platform, with a physical controller included, while Apple Arcade is more about simpler games that can run on multiple devices with or without a controller. Nintendo makes a profit from every console they sell, not just games. And games they made take full advantage of the hardware. Their hardware doesn't need to be an everyday computer and can cost less, lowering the entry barrier. Nintendo 2DS costs $80, Apple will never make an iOS device so cheap.

What makes sense is Nintendo mobile games on Apple Arcade. Apple doesn't need to buy Nintendo to make this happen. Super Mario Run playable without an internet connection, that's what we need.
