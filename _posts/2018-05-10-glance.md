I should've write about this earlier but couldnâ€™t find time. I still want to, because this is big step in my life. I left [Glance Creative,][1] app agency where I worked for almost 3 years. [^2] All this time together with great CEO, amazing people and doing my best work. Glance has big portfolio, it was fun to work on different projects and ship one app after another.

I left Glance so I can start new role at [IG.][5] I was flattered to receive offer from them, it's hard to find good place to work in my situation [^4], even in London. I'm fortunate to be able to continue to earn money from doing something I love.

[^2]:2 years at Locassa, and 1 year at Glance. I usually combine this periods, because 2 companies share same people.

[^4]:I don't have British or EU passport, I can only work in UK under special visa called Tier-2. Visa can be sponsored not by every company and it requires special certificate. On top of extra expenses and paper work, sponsor needs to do market search for 30 days and try to find another candidate from UK or EU before it can hire Tier-2 immigrant.
