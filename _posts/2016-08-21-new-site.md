For long time I wasn't satisfied with Tumblr. My concerns were inability to have a backup, the fact that everything I publish do not belong to me, incredible heaviness of Tumblr, bad markdown support, problems posting multiple images and luck of control in general.

I am in full control of this new site which is good for the web as an independent platform, looking on you, Facebook. I am committed to do a better job with it, including editing old material, using better style and grammar of course. 

## New site is smaller.

You reading this from my new site which front page with the same 10 posts is about 900 KB against old 2.4 MB.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/old-site.png" alt="Safari window which shows old Tumblr blog with web inspector. It has borders, looks grey, has Tumblr customise buttons and looks very heavy in general." width="100%" title="Old site size is 2.42 MB." />
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/new-site.png" alt="Screenshot that show Safari window with this blog on it and web inspector. It has light yellow background." title="New site size is 890 KB." width="100%" />

## New features.

My blog is also supports syntax highlighter and trendy link posts. You can distinguish them by little anchor icon.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/link-post-example.png" width="247px" alt="Screenshot that shows one red coloured title on a yellow background with anchor icon on the left." title="Link post title with an anchor." />

This means I can post code snippets:

{% highlight swift %}
print("Hello World")
{% endhighlight %}

Don't worry, I am not getting into too much technical details, I know that some or most of my readers are not programmers. And when I do, I will make sure you can understand everything without any programming knowledge.

## Accessibility.

I do care about accessibility, I am adding `alt` and `title` tags to all images, so even if you can't see, you know what pictures showing.

## Privacy and feedback.

In terms of privacy, I am not using any cookies or any analytics on this site. It's true, look into the source by pressing `command + option + i` [^1]. This means I have no idea how many people reading this and where are you from. I don't need to know, if something turns out extremely popular, I will know.

## Technical details.

I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. Jekyll allows me to run a local instance of this site to preview changes before I publish with Git. Jekyll is written on Ruby.
