All my iOS wallpapers are black. I am using simple black wallpaper for iPhone more than 3 years and now also trying it on iPad. Black wallpaper has following perks.

* Less visual noise on the Home Screen. 
* App icons easier to recognise.
* Matches nicely with black bezel.[^1]
* You not getting tired looking at it.

Note original iPhone had black wallpaper.

## How to Make One.

Unfortunately Apple doesn't include it with iOS. To make your own you can use [Pixelmator app.](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8&uo=4&at=1010l4GJ)

1. Open Pixelmator app.
2. Tap on the + icon to *Create Image.*
3. Select *Custom...*
4. You will get empty canvas with your device screen size. Tap *Create.*
5. Tap on the + icon, select Layers control.

6. Select black square.
7. Tap Activity Sheet button and save image to Photos.
8. Open Photos, tap on the Activity Sheet icon and tap *Use as Wallpaper.*
