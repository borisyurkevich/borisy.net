The Console app has many features, one of them is browsing recent Mac crashes. [Unexpectedly](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Unexpectedly/about.html) — a new open-source app from Stéphane Sudre advances this area of the Console with  quality of life improvements like highlighted syntax and hyperlinks. It looks gorgeous, get it.
