Safari has the SnapBack feature to go back to the search results. If your search engine uses the same tab when you click on any link, often you could lose search results and would have to click back several times. Safari caches the search results page and you can open it through the menu command: History > Search Results SnapBack. There's a keyboard shortcut: Option-Command-S.
