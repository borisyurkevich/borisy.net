<p>Every company that have web and native app should promote native. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html">Safari smart banner is perfect tool.</a></p>

<p>Tumblr mobile web site goes further. This is the best practice. Don&rsquo;t just point the user to your native app. Keep your user in a flow by transfering data alongside.</p>

<p>Still, this is not good enough. By tapping link in web app you should transfer not just a link to a specific data to open this data in native app. Web app should transfer the progress that already was made. For example, list from a shopping cart.</p>
