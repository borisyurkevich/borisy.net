Michael E. Cohen from TidBITS wrote amazing post revealing details about current iBooks state. Even found "irritating" Truncated Serif bug I never noticed before.

His conclusion:

> iBooks is not quite as unreliable and confusing as it was when I wrote about it last year, but neither has it improved nearly as much as loyal iBooks users deserve. Moreover, what little support documentation Apple provides is sketchy and inaccurate, leaving the impression that even the support and documentation departments within Apple are ignoring iBooks.

I wrote about iBooks stagnation [2 weeks ago,](http://borisy.net/2017/02/06/backing-up-ibooks-drm-and-region-switching/) glad I'm not the only one concerned about its future.
