SwiftUI is the future of app development. For the first time there's unified way to write powerful applications for all Apple platforms. 

There is 3 revolutions in personal computing technology.

1. Mac and GUI.
2. The open web.
3. iPhone.

Each of this shifts were possible with a bunch of new technologies. I have a sense that SwiftUI can be one of those building blocks in the next step, democratising technology and opening new ways developers can build their applications. The reason I see its significance is that it combines strength of native development and convenience of the web, it builds up on technologies of the past. The same way open web wouldn't be possible without computer in each household.

It might be limited to Apple world (fine with me), nevertheless, if SwiftUI proves itself as a success, it will be used to develop for the new platform, possibly AR/VR. The rest of industry will follow in adopting declarative way of programming user interfaces. I can not afford to miss this new revolution, I am very much committed to SwiftUI at this point.
