  <p><a href="https://www.imagecomics.com/">Image Comics</a> announced that it will now sell all of its digital comics as downloadable via its website for both desktop and mobile users — making it the first major American comics publisher to offer readers DRM-free digital versions of comics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://www.comixology.com">Comixology</a> for more then a year. Few days ago I realised that I really don&rsquo;t own all comics I bought. I only have a license to read them from only one app.</p>

<p>Now think, what if?</p>

<ol><li>New Comixology app update will make it look/work terrible.</li>
<li>You want to give a comic to your friend.</li>
<li>Comics you bought <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/comixology-pulls-ios-releases/">will be pulled out</a> from Comixology store because disagreement with publisher or App Store will go after it.</li>
<li>You want to back up your data.</li>
</ol><p>In all this cases you&rsquo;re in trouble. Good news, The Walking Dead and Saga publisher — Image Comics already selling DRM-free comics.</p>

<p>Prices not so good. Saga issue is $2.99 VS $1.99 in Comixology and You can not buy bundles yet. But I encourage you to buy DRM-free products.</p>
