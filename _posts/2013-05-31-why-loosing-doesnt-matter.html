<p>I played video games a lot. Best games is a fine art for me — like book or movie. But StarCraft Ⅱ is something different. You can play it 100 times and every battle will be different. Every game you&rsquo;re learning, gaining confidence, playing better and better and &hellip; losing.</p>

<p>At first losing seams wrong and painful. In FPS you&rsquo;re trying to do more kills, in StarCraft — to improve your micro and macro. In FPS once you&rsquo;re becoming better — your winning ratio growing. It takes some time to accept it. In StarCraft while you&rsquo;re playing stronger — Battle.net gives you equal opponents — so losing and winning is around 50%.</p>

<p>Winns giving more points — that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re moving up on the ladder. Wins giving you a burst of happiness but real satisfaction coming when after a game with your pro buddy he or she telling you — &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a whole new level you’re playing, a different game&rdquo;. One victory is just a small instant reward. You can always win or lose more on a next season. Skills is not going away. They growing. Noticing my progress is what pushing me forward.</p>
