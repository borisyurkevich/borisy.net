<p>It is easy to hate. When I saw leaked mockup I thought: <em>— This can&rsquo;t be serious, looks not professional.</em>
When I saw WWDC keynote I thought: <em>— Icons look bad.</em> But some part of me didn&rsquo;t wanted to believe that this is a misstep.</p>

<p>So I asked myself: <em>— How it would feel in your hands?</em> Apple hinted on their website: <strong>designed to <em>work</em> beautifully</strong> not <strong>designed to <em>look</em> beautifully.</strong> Are you familiar when some gadget looks beautiful on a shelf and after you&rsquo;re starting using it — you&rsquo;re getting tired and bored? Jonathan Ive has balls to built something that&rsquo;s not trying to seduce you by first look. This is doesn&rsquo;t mean he didn&rsquo;t worked hard enough or that he has a bad taste. Johnny knew what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>

<p>I think the secret is what people are not noticing from first glance — <strong>the grid system.</strong> Apple already used that with iCloud icon. New design brings a natural order. You know things like symmetry, math, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio/" title="link to Wikipedia page">golden ratio</a> and biology — all this stuff our Universe built on.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re looking at Netbot or Fantastical apps — you&rsquo;re thinking: <em>— Icon looks perfect.</em> Are you following? This is like looking at glamorous magazines with beatifull people. Fantastical icon with multiple colors, squeres and pages. It tells you that you&rsquo;re have a lot of stuff ahead. It makes you feel bad because you&rsquo;re not perfect. Fantastical icon so cool that you loosing your cool, Calendar becoming an unreachable ideal gorgeousness.</p>

<p>I want to use iOS 7 because I hope it will fill better. New childish icons makes you more confident in using your favorite apps. They looks like some kid painted them — so it makes you feel like:  <em>— If this icon looks so easy I can handle this app.</em></p>

<p>By the way, all other things are not so controversy. I looked at <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/design/" title="Link to Apple home page">all iOS 7 pictures at Apple web site</a> and now iOS 6 looks old and unnecessary heavy.  Especially Settings table view, Wheather app, horrible top blue bar, black top bar, switch buttons, glossy date pickers&hellip;</p>

<p>iOS 7 is a day-to-day unfamous hero that ready to help you any minute. This is a start of a new era in software design.</p>
