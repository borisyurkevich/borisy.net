<p>Penultimate iPad app is updated. Some users are in rage and writing a lot of one star reviews. Those reviews are not valid representation of what most people think. Users  which are OK or even happy with changes do not have a reason to write a review because they are already satisfied.</p>

<p>Old design looks &ldquo;classy&rdquo; with brown notebooks, physical pages, point of beginning and point of end without any kind of ability to separate different notes in one notebook. While using Penultimate 5 I thought this kind of UI is appropriate. Until I saw new design which respects and embraces iOS 7 paradigm. Starting from icon, all chrome are gone embracing the content.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using iPad Air so I can survive without zoom mode and new full screen look makes it more possible. People with iPad mini will miss cool auto scroll function, which I hope will be added in the future. One thing which confused me is titles, but there is a switch in app&rsquo;s settings.</p>

<p>Small amount of people are in rage, but this changes are better for most users. We need to think in a new digital way with infinity scrolling and go away from old cumbersome paper-like style UI.</p>
