I have long stopped using Reddit's current design, and have been using [old.reddit.com][5] instead. A new direction is not just about looks but about increasing the number of clicks and subscribers through applying [dark and grey design patterns][1]. The website trying to silo you into their app and make an impression that an account is required to see some of the content. On top of that, a new design has less information density and is much slower to load.

I put a lot of effort into [my work][2]. After all, I want my products to offer something new and be better than alternatives because I use them myself. And I am not a minority, for every Reddit and Facebook out there there's [Patreon][3] and [Pinboard][4]. Technology might appear like it's all about numbers and revenue, but it only truly makes a difference when we put our users needs first. Using and loving your product is a great practice and the best thing you can do to your roadmap. Unlike A/B testing and analytics, it's free. So let the dinosaurs grow, and die, without realising that they are on the wrong side of history.
