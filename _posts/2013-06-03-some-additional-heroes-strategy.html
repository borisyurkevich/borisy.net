<p>What a great game from Hero on WCS America.</p>

<p><em>From Major League Gaming Facebook page</em></p>

<h2>1 Micro Sentries</h2>

<p>Hero under huge stress holded strong defence with force-fields. 
That moment when bunch of centries and few stalkers killed 30 or so speedlings without single unit loss. He even killed 4 zerglings without his probes with only 1 probe killed. In a blink protoss small army was covered from all sides with force fields. Speedlings just maked circles around and died.
He managed to harass with a probe on Zergs natural and builded blocking mineral line pylon.</p>

<h2>2 Late Proxy</h2>

<p>Usually players harassing only in the beginning of a game. On some maps such as Cloud Kingdom protoss can build proxy pylon on opposite conner opponents base. Hero warped 4-5 zealots in late game when so many things happened on the screen and your opponent third is vulnerable. That third base can be attached multiple times while you&rsquo;re distracting your opponent with main army.</p>

<h2>3 Zealot position</h2>

<p>Put your Zealots so he can be protected from all 3 sides except front. Use minerals and even Xel'naga tower.</p>
