I decided that I'm better of not tweeting. I read most of the tweets from people I follow, but I don't think that my tweeting provides any value. I would rather focus my efforts on this blog. Finishing a blog post always feels good. feels like I am doing something meaningful. 

There's [Tweetbot 6][1] update and if you still use the official Twitter app, I recommend installing and try it. The app is now free but requires a subscription if you want to tweet. Works for me. ðŸ™‚
