<p>Following posts will be related to my new app — <a href="http://borisy.net/altershot">Altershot.</a></p>

<p>The idea came to me when I was on using my iPhone to post screenshot image to a Twitter from <a href="http://twitterrific.com/ios">Twitterrific</a> app. I thought it would be nice to cut out status bar out of picture. iOS App Store has not any apps for this. I was an active Status Magic user on OS X. That’s how Altershot idea was born.</p>

<p>The app doesn’t called Altershot from beginning. I submitted first build with name <em>AlterStatus</em> name. App was rejected, I will write about this later. I had an opportunity to come up with a new name. I picked <em>AlterShot</em> and then changed it to <em>Altershot.</em></p>

<p>How to pick a perfect iOS app name? For me it need to be unique and short as possible. Combining two words will guarantee uniqueness. I wrote all possible combinations starting from a new line and picked the shortest. I’m not insist on combining of two words. Even more, I think picking one word name is more stylish. For example, <a href="http://vesperapp.co">Vesper.</a> You need to find a balance between uniqueness and transparency. The user should understand app purpose from its name. <em>Mail</em>, <em>Maps</em> and <em>Notes</em> are perfect example. Too bad they are way too general which adds some complications for blogging and marketing. Should I write Mail or maybe Mail.app. Or Apple Mail?</p>

<p>Should you choose regular Capitalisation or CamelCase is up to you. I already got <a href="http://borisy.net/numpick">NumPick</a> on the App Store. That’s why I started with CamelCase. Then I decided that’s it’s too ugly and harder to read. Imagine <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> as EverNote. Terrible.</p>
