![Apple Watch with UTILITY face.][1]

In 2016 Apple released Apple Watch Series 1. I still wear them to this day, even at night. Here's how this little computer improves my daily live.

**Telling Time and Counting Seconds.**

I always loved to wear watches, that's a very obvious reason, but also most important reason to own a watch. I find analogue watch faces relaxing and much easier to scan than digital faces.

For the 60-30 seconds timers. I don't even need to launch a timer. I look at my wrist twice, memorising Seconds Hand position. 

This also works with traditional mechanical watches and even with iOS Springboard. It's very Apple-like thing, when you look at your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch with the Seconds Hand perfectly in sync rotating smoothly.

**iMessage and Telegram Notifications.**

Because I sometimes leave my iPhone behind, there's always risk to miss an important message from people I know. Both of this apps value my privacy and allow to reply right from the Apple Watch.

**Breath App.**

Such a wonderful lightweight app. I try to use it as much as I can. We even use it together with my son, it helps me to relax and it helps him to fall asleep sometimes.

**Siri and Dictation.**

It's not the fastest device to access Siri, but it is much better than nothing, and it is always with me. I use it to send messages to my wive, set reminders and add new items to [OmniFocus](https://omnifocus.com/). 

**Battery Complication.**

The battery is old, so I have to charge it at least 3 times a day for at least 20 minutes at a time.

**Sleep Tacking and Caffeine logging.**

My favourite thing about [AutoSleep](http://autosleep.tantsissa.com) is that it works automatically and doesn't require me to launch the app. When I do launch it, I find it a bit over-engineered.

For caffeine tracking, I have build an app which I like to use every day â€“ [Caffeine++](/caffeine++). I find it fast and convenient.
