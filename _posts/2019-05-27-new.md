![Apple Watch with UTILITY face.][1]

In 2016 Apple released Apple Watch Series 1. I still wear them to this day, even at night. Here's how this little computer improves my daily life.

**Telling Time and Counting Seconds.**

I love to wear a watch. I find analogue watch faces relaxing and much easier to scan than digital faces.

For the 60, 30 seconds timers, I look at my wrist and memorise Seconds Hand position. Two, three glances, and I'm done. I don't need to launch the Timer app.

This also works with traditional mechanical watches and even with iOS Springboard. It's a very Apple-like thing when you look at your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch with the Seconds Hand perfectly in sync rotating smoothly.

**iMessage and Telegram Notifications.**

Because I sometimes leave my iPhone behind, there's always a risk to miss an important message from people I know. Both of this apps value my privacy and allow me to reply right from the Apple Watch.

**Breath App.**

Such a wonderful lightweight app. I try to use Breath as much as I can. We even use it together with my son, it helps me to relax and it helps him to fall asleep sometimes.

**Siri and Dictation.**

It's not the fastest device to access Siri, but it is much better than nothing, and it is always with me. I use it to text my wife, set reminders and add new items to [OmniFocus](https://omnifocus.com/). 

**Battery Complication.**

The battery in my unit is old, so I have to charge it at least 2-3 times a day for at least 15-30 minutes at a time.

**Sleep Tacking and Caffeine Logging.**

My favourite thing about [AutoSleep](http://autosleep.tantsissa.com) is that it works automatically and doesn't require me to launch the app. When I do launch it, I find it a bit over-engineered.

For caffeine tracking, I have created [Caffeine++](/caffeine++). I use it every day. I find it fast and convenient.
